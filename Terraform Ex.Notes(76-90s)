76. Terraform Output 
-------------------

terraform has the Output vaiable {

}

* You can run the terraform plan again to see the old output 
* can inspect the tf.state file and see the output blocks 
Run: terraform output <output-valuable> 

This would pull updates from the output which could be an input for a script for a new file.

77. Specific versions to run the code 
----------------------------------------
Terraform blocks are used for code blocks that runs on specific versions. 
Declates the latest versions of the TF plugins. 

terraform{
required_version = "1.08" 

required_providers {
  aws = {
      version = 5.7
      source = "harshicorp/aws"
  }
}
}

When we run "terraform plan" would fail, as its expecting the exact version of the terraform. 
Adding required_providers block can be used to declare the provider details and the versions.
