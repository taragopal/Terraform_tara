TERRAFORM NOTES

61. Data source - FORMAT
-------------------------
Using the data source block we can fetch a particular instance. Look for the details of this in the AWS Resource -> Documentation panel. 
Data source uses tags, which are very important to maintain a large environment with 1000s of instances. 

Ask @need to research on the usecases, apart from update, environment seggregation and network related changes, can there be any use of this on Application deployment ? 

data "aws_instance" "foo" {
instance_id = "i-instance-id" 
}

filter{
name = "image-id"
values = ["ami-xxxxxx"]
}

filter{
name = "tag:name"
values = ["instance-name-tag] 
} 

62. Usecase = Problem Definition :Fetch the latest OS image using Data Source
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Avoid hard coded static values in Terraform code. 
Use terraform to query the latest OS image and using that to create an instance. 

63. Usecase: Solution
-----------------------
could not find the os_release | ami_id | latest_patch in the Azure Resource block, not able to convert this for Azure. 

64. Debugging in TERRAFORM 
---------------------------

40% of time will go into Debugging. Documentation / config issue. 
-- Always maintain a detailed log.
